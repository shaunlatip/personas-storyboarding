              <h3 >Background</h3>
              <p>
                My goal for this study was to better understand the experiences of users checking in for scheduled clinical appointments at Brown University's new Health Services clinic.
                <br>
                <br>
                The new check in station my study centers on was <a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2021-09-16/wellness">launched</a> in September of 2021 as part of a new, integrated Health and Wellness center, combining the previously separated Health Services alongside Counseling and Psychological Services into one centralized point of care in the middle of Brown University's campus. 
                <br>
                <br>As someone interested in and personally invested towards the accessibility of healthcare on campus, I wanted to evaluate the experiences of patients to understand and communicate the condition of this facet of Brown's campus healthcare system.

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                The check-in station consisted of four distinct, interactable sections:

                <b>Desktop Check-in Booth</b>  where users validate their identity and update health information. <br>

                <b>Seating Area</b> for users to sit and wait for their names to be called after using the booth. <br>

                A printed page instructs users to “Please sign in with the computers across from staff.” <br>
                <br>
                <b>Clinical Area Main Door</b> where nurses primarily call checked-in users inside to meet providers, and escort users out afterwards. Two other secondary doors are also used to the left and behind the sketched area.

              <h3>Desktop UI</h3>
              <p>
                The Desktop interface is itself comprised of three main components:

              <h3>Observations</h3>
              <p>
                Over two weekdays, I waited in the public seating area and observed 12 users from morning to afternoon.
                <br>
                <br>
                I avoided observing up close how users filled out forms on the desktop check-in to respect their privacy.
                Instead, I focused on observing how each user navigated the station, including how long they lingered on each section, and their interactions with staff.
              </p>
              <div class="focused-text-container">

                  <ul>
  
                    <li>
                      8 users first approached staff in the Greeter Area instead of the desktops.
                      <ul>
                        <li>Half of these users stood and waited for several minutes while staff were busy, all without noticing the printed instructional page to use the computer.</li>
                        <li>Most of them seemed somewhat confused upon entering the check-in area, with the staff telling most to just use the computer.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
  
                    <br>
  
                    <li>
                      3 users were late to their appointment. These users tended to rush directly to a desktop, check in, then approach staff to apologize and see if they could still be seen.
                      <ul>
                        <li>User A spent 10 minutes rescheduling with staff, as User A’s schedule conflicted with many of the suggested times.</li>
                        <li>User A remarked: "<i>I’m a med student…I can’t control when my lab ends</i>.”</li>
                      </ul>

                    <li>
                      3 users arrived holding a prescription from the downstairs pharmacy, with 2 stating they came for vaccinations.

                      The doors to the clinical area create a startling “Bang!” whenever opened, interrupting nearly everyone waiting from what they are doing and causing them to look up.

              <p>
                Of those I observed, I interviewed Users A, B and H after they left the clinical area. I selected my interviewees based on how distinct their observed behaviors were to capture a more exhaustive range of patterns across diverse groups.
                <br> 
                <br>While I followed my eight questions, I also followed up on related topics that my interviewees expressed interest in discussing, while casually conversing afterwards and answering questions they had about my project.

                    <li>Users B and H were both first time users and undergraduates on campus for less than 2 years. Both were unsure on which section to first approach and expressed anxiety while approaching staff and on how their presence could be acknowledged by clinicians.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>User H complained how, despite arriving early, the desktop check-in took far longer than they expected causing H to be seen late.</li>

                    <li>User A, a med student, has been using the system very often for 5 years and claimed to be able to now check in extremely quickly “<i>without reading instructions.</i>”</li>

                    <li>User A wished the desktop involved less physical contact, as once the student before A coughed on the keyboard as A was running late with no time to sanitize. They also wished a way existed to display a wait time and queue for those waiting.</li>

                    She arrives at the building, slamming open the door and sprinting up the stairs, 
                    as the user before her leaves their booth while coughing right into the keyboard.

                    After heading straight towards the nearest available counter, Sakshi, while grossed out, furiously clicks and types through the program just as she's done a thousand times.

                    Through each section, Sakshi ignores the paragraphs of dense instructions and text; using her experience to speed through the clunky program ASAP to not miss her appointment.

                    Unfortunately after the program says she is too late, she goes to the Greeter Area and makes her case:
                    "I'm sorry I'm late - I came here as fast as I could!"

                    They spend the next ten minutes trying to reschedule. They go back and forth: “2:00PM? No I cant do then, could 2:00pm Wednesday work?" "...What about Thursday?...Friday? [and so on]...”

                All in all, I really enjoyed being able to conduct this research project. Despite being a frequent user of the check in station myself, I was surprised at how my findings of what different people wanted and got out from their experience checking in could differ so much from my own expectations. It was also a great experience to apply web design principles I knew from theory to use HTML and CSS to create a responsive webpage to showcase my research process. As I learn more, I hope to sometime redesign the way users access clinical care at 450 Brook St. based on my findings.
